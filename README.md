# The Great Hashtag Removal Challenge 🚫#️⃣

## The Legendary Hash Removal Challenge 🕵️‍♂️

Welcome to the most crucial open-source project of our time! 

### 🌟 Project Background
Inspired by the infamous urban legend of an ex-Amazon engineer who allegedly brought down an entire system by forgetting a `#`, we're here to save the tech world - one hash symbol at a time!

### 🎯 Mission
Remove every single `#` from our codebase and watch the magic happen (spoiler: nothing will happen, because that's not how software works 😂)

### 🤝 How to Contribute
1. Fork the repository
2. Find a code file
3. Remove a `#` (remove only 1 #, it is restricted to one # per person)
4. Create a pull request
5. Laugh at the absurdity

### 🏆 Contribution Guidelines
- Each pull request must remove at least one `#`
- No actual functionality should be broken
- Maintain code readability
- Keep the humor alive!

### 🚨 Disclaimer
This is a JOKE project. Do NOT attempt to remove preprocessor directives in real-world production code.

### 🤖 Languages Supported
- Python
- JavaScript
- Java
- C
- + you can contribute to more language

### 🍿 Hall of Fame
Contributors who've bravely removed the hash will be immortalized here!
